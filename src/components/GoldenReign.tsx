            <p>Welcome to the era where everything was golden! Literally! Here are some highlights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Year of the Great Banana Festival:</strong> A festival so grand, even the bananas were in awe!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Day of the Infinite Sweets:</strong> When the kingdom ran out of sugar, we just used more payasam!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Building the Great Coconut Palace:</strong> A palace so shiny, it could be seen from space (or at least from the next village).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Establishing the Order of the Payasam:</strong> A group dedicated to the art of making the perfect payasam. Spoiler: It involves a lot of tasting!
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Join us as we celebrate the reign that was not just golden, but also deliciously sweet!</p>
