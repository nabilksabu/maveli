            <h1>About Maaveli</h1>
            <p>
                Once upon a time in the land of Kerala, there lived a king named Maaveli, 
                who was so beloved that he was often mistaken for a superhero. 
                Legend has it that he could make the best payasam in the kingdom, 
                and his reign was so golden that even the sun was jealous!
            </p>
            <h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Maaveli once challenged a coconut tree to a height contest and won!</li>
                <li>His favorite pastime? Organizing payasam-eating contests!</li>
                <li>He had a pet elephant named "Payasam Pappan" who loved sweets more than anything!</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>His Legacy:</h2>
            <p>
                Maaveli's reign was marked by prosperity and happiness. 
                People say that if you listen closely during Onam, you can still hear him 
                laughing and sharing stories of his adventures while serving payasam to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, if you ever find yourself in Kerala during Onam, 
                remember to look out for Maaveli's spirit and enjoy a bowl of payasam in his honor!
